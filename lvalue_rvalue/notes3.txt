Now we have removed 2 func() functions. What is left is func() which accepts an int reference
and a func() which accepts an rvalue int. 

The compiler is complaining because we are attempting to send y, a const, to a function that
accepts a non-const value. This would remove the protection that const offers y and therefore
the compiler says no.
