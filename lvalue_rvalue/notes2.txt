The last output line changed to a const lvalue reference. Disabling the if pragma caused
the code within the block not to be compiled, so the compiler had to select another function
for move(y) to be sent to. move() returns an rvalue, but y is also a const, so it opted to send
y to the const l value parameter so that the value would remain a const.
