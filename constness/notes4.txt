Uncommenting line 1, line 2, or line 1 and 2 causes the compiler to complain about s.append. 
This is because calling s.append() is attempting to modify the string but the string
is declared as constant which is meant to be immutable.
s.size() is allowed because it does not perform any changes to the variable, even declaring
its parameter as constant.
