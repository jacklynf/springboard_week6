The compiler complains about non_const_by_ref() because we are sending the address
of a constant variable to the function to be modified. This means that when append()
is called, it is attempting to modify a constant which is not allowed.

It does not complain on the call to non_const_by_val() because we're sending a copy - 
this means we are not violating the original cs's const-ness.
