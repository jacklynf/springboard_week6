Here we have instantiated a Cow and a FullCow. Both are derived classes from the base class Animal.

We then call the function poke() which takes a by-reference argument to our base class, Animal. poke()  
calls the virtual function makesound().

makesound() is called by its parameter variable, animal, which is type Animal but is passed a reference to the
derived classes on each call that we've made here.

makesound() is a virtual function in the base and derived classes, and override is declared in the derived classes.
So when we call makesound() using a reference to the derived class, the compiler knows to use the makesound() function
associated with the respective derived classes.
